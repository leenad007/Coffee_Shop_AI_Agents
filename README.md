**1. Development and Deployment Workflow**

    Data Sources:

    - Product Details: Includes name, description, price, and other metadata.
    - Historical Orders Data: Used to power recommendation engines.
    - Product Images: Managed and uploaded via Firebase for 

**2. Embedding and Recommendation Engine:**

    Utilizes Hugging Face for embedding generation using models like bge-small-en-v1.5.

    The Apriori Algorithm is implemented to provide product recommendations.

    Agents are orchestrated as follows:

    - Guard Agent: Ensures safety and compliance.
    - Classification Agent: Directs user inputs to the appropriate agent.
    - Details Agent: Retrieves product information.
    - Order Taking Agent: Manages order placement.
    - Recommendation Agent: Provides suggestions based on user preferences.

**3. Firebase Integration:**

    All images are stored and managed using Firebase.

    Firebase Uploader handles image and data uploads seamlessly.

**4. Containerization and Deployment:**

    A Docker image is created for API services and uploaded to DockerHub.

    The application is deployed and accessible through RunPod endpoints for serverless execution.


**5. Multi-Agent and RAG Workflow**

    Agent Workflow:

    User inputs are classified by the Input Classifier Agent to determine the query type.
    Safe questions bypass the Guard Agent; otherwise, the input is validated.
    
    Depending on the query:
    Order Agent processes orders.
    Recommendation Agent suggests products.
    Details Agent retrieves product data.
    
    Response Coordination:
    Responses are fetched from the RunPod API and sent back to the user


**6. Android Application Development**

    Frontend Development:

    Built using React Native, leveraging TypeScript for type safety and JavaScript for component logic.

    The mobile app integrates the chatbot interface for engaging user interactions.

### **Application Flow**

1. **Home Screen**: Displays a curated list of products and quick access to the chatbot.
2. **Chatbot (ChatRoom)**: Engages users with AI-driven conversational responses, recommendations, and order placement.
3. **Product Details**: Provides detailed product information, ratings, and an option to "Buy Now."
4. **Cart and Orders**: Users can view, edit, and place orders directly from their cart.
5. **Thank You Page**: Displays a confirmation message with animations upon successful order placement.
